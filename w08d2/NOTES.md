What is the difference between back-end routing and front-end routing?

- When it's navigation from 'page to page' in an SPA, that's front-end routing.
- If you need to get or set data, you'll use back-end routing.

* React Router

Here are the menu items we will put in place for the SPOTlight Objectives DB

Home
List
Login

In your React Components, if you are linking to URLs within your application, it is best to not use <a> tags directly. Instead, the 'react-router-dom' package will allow you to use a <Link> component.

2) npm install react-router-dom

3) Here is some code that shows 

<Link to="/">Home</Link>
<Link to="/objectives">Objectives</Link>
<Link to="/login">Login</Link>

error: You should not use <Link> outside of a <Router>

<Router> needs to go into the top level component.

So...

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

<Router>
  <Link to="/">Home</Link>
  <Link to="/">List</Link>
</Router>


<Route> tags match paths with components to render.

<Route path="/" exact>
  <h1>Home Page</h1>
</Route>

<Route path="/search">
  <Search/>
</Route>

<Route path="*">
  <h2>404 - Not Found</h2>
</Route>


<Switch></Switch> wrap Routes in this tag to force the system to adopt the first matched <Route>

6) a few coding tips:
a) destructuring your props directly in the component's function definition is somewhat self documenting.
b)
{ loading && <h1>loading</h1> }
{ !loading && <h1>HERE ARE THE GOODS</h1> }

7)
useParams(); returns an object that contains the URL parameters

8)
const history = useHistory();
const {path} = useRouteMatch();
history.push(`${path}?search=${fieldState}`);

9) Context Demo (Counter Culture!)
- Context (to avoid 'prop drilling')

10) const {search} = useLocation(); // get the query string from the URL

npm install query-string ( || yarn add query-string)
